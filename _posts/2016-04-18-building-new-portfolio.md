title: Building a (new) Portolio
---

During my UX/UI design course, I built a portfolio site "from scratch" but it really didn't fully embody the aesthetic and functional growth I completed throughout the entire Bloc program, nor did the site have any content management system. I forked and cloned a Jekyll template instead, then edited the Sass and other visual components to mimic the style that I had cultivated in the previous portfolio iteration.

I ditched the Lobster font, but kept the spiral and background, and did a few minutes of research to learn how to link text to the Github versions of my UX/UI design work.
