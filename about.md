Frontend Developer.
UX/UI Designer.

Art Educator.
Art Historian.

I use HTML/CSS, Sass, vanilla Javascript, jQuery, AngularJS, Bootstrap, Foundation, or Skeleton to produce a web site or single page application. I know my way around Jekyll, and am pretty confident with Git and the command line. My goal is to make sites responsive and look good on any size screen.

I am always learning something, ask me what is next!
