I enjoy learning, visiting people, ocean breezes, trees. 

I am a total art history nerd and have loved many things, including wine, World of Warcraft, the Spanish language, beginning quilting, and cooking.

I have a BA from Carleton College, of Northfield, Minnesota, in Art History, and a Certificate of Advanced Study in Spanish. 

I have a MAT from George Mason University, of Fairfax, Virginia, in Art Education, and I am certified PK-12 in Art Education.

I live in Northern Virginia with a tiny human (toddler) and awesome husband.
