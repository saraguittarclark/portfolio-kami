Frontend Developer.
UX/UI Designer.

Art Educator.

Art Historian.

I use HTML/CSS, Sass, vanilla Javascript, jQuery, AngularJS, Bootstrap, Foundation, or Skeleton to produce a web site or single page application. I know my way around Jekyll, and am pretty confident with Git. My goal is to make sites responsive and look good on any size screen.

I am always learning something, ask me what is next!

Stats:

MAT from George Mason University, of Fairfax, Virginia, in Art Education, and I am certified PK-12 in Art Education. 
I taught K-6 art education for 3 years in Fairfax County Public Schools.

I have a BA from Carleton College, of Northfield, Minnesota, in Art History, and a Certificate of Advanced Study in Spanish. 

I love many things: the Spanish language, art of all kinds even (some) postmodern works, quilting, and cooking.
