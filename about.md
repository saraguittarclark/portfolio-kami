Frontend Developer.
UX/UI Designer.

Art Educator.

Art Historian.

I use HTML/CSS, Sass, vanilla Javascript, jQuery, AngularJS, Bootstrap, Foundation, or Skeleton to produce a web site or single page application. I know my way around Jekyll, and am pretty confident with Git. My goal is to make sites responsive and look good on any size screen.

I am always learning something, ask me what is next!

Bio:

When I was a teenager, my favorite movies (or tv shows) had some main character hacking their way out of situations and using their powers for good (with few exceptions). I wanted to be that person. My dad owned a small computer retail store and my favorite first games were Minesweeper and some Doom-like German game with crows. (Anyone?)

I entered college, and fell in love with art history. My first class was Buddhist Art, then Medieval Art, then the introductory classes, and then it was all I wanted to study. Art history taught me to look closely and find details that can tell a complete story. I still loved the idea of computer science (hacking has a name!), but with one woman out of thirteen in the major, I felt more intellectually safe analyzing Dutch portraits and landscapes of the Golden Era.

I worked in Museum Education, and then received a Master's of Arts in Teaching for Art Education, and worked as a K-6 art teacher, until I was able to have a beautiful daughter. While on maternity leave, I thought about learning to code. I had met a UX Designer, and I knew women were entering the field. I decided to go through some Codecademy classes. My husband, one of the aforementioned thirteen computer science majors, thought this would be fun for him and good for me, so I kept working and learning and completed [Bloc.io's](http://www.bloc.io){:target="_blank"} UX/UI Design and Frontend Development program in May 2016.



Stats:

MAT from George Mason University, of Fairfax, Virginia, in Art Education, and I am certified PK-12 in Art Education. 
I taught K-6 art education for 3 years in Fairfax County Public Schools.

I have a BA from Carleton College, of Northfield, Minnesota, in Art History, and a Certificate of Advanced Study in Spanish. 

I love many things: the Spanish language, art of all kinds even (some) postmodern works, quilting, and cooking.
