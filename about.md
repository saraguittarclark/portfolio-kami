I enjoy learning, visiting people, ocean breezes, and trees. 

I am a total art history nerd and have loved many things, including wine, World of Warcraft, the Spanish language, beginning quilting, and cooking.

I graduate from [Bloc.io's](http://www.bloc.io){:target="_blank"} UX/UI Design and Frontend Development program in May 2016.

I have a BA from Carleton College, of Northfield, Minnesota, in Art History, and a Certificate of Advanced Study in Spanish. 

I have a MAT from George Mason University, of Fairfax, Virginia, in Art Education, and I am certified PK-12 in Art Education. I taught K-6 art education for 3 years in Fairfax County Public Schools.

I live in Northern Virginia with an energetic toddler and awesome husband.
