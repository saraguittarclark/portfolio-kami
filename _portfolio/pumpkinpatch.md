## Explanation

Pumpkin Patch is a retail site conceived and designed for a busy urban professional or parent that wants a pumpkin for decoration, baking, or carving, but has no time to visit a pumpkin patch. (This project was created in the autumn.) I used the Foundation CSS framework and Sass to develop the prototype of the website.

## Problem

This idea was conceived as a retail/service for those who work long or unusual hours to have an opportunity to pick out a certain variety of pumpkin to use for Jack O'Lanterns, decoration, or authentic pumpkin pie. The website would need to display good images of the variety, provide a way of sorting the different varieties by color or size, and have a smooth checkout experience. 

## Solution

I created a retail website that consumers could interact with and navigate between the different sizes of pumpkins. I used Invision.io to refine user flows and conduct user testing to ensure a smooth and interactive user experience.

## Conclusion

It was a great challenge to design and prototype a larger retail website, and consider the varieties of different user stories and experiences. I had a fun time designing and applying the diagonal border/shape at the header of the site, and experimenting with Sass and Foundation to produce a responsive grid and layout.
