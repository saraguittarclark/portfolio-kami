## Explanation

Stellar Shipping and Transport is a (alas) fictional company used to practice creating a landing page for a company or service. 

## Problem

Creating a page for a fictional company was both challenging and fun. I was able to control and invent the crew, spaceship, routes, and logo. However, inventing this much backstory was probably not something I would do again because of the challenges involved. I wanted the unreality of the concept to be seen as a normal, approachable reality in the website.

## Solution

I created several drafts of a design and conducted user tests to attempt to strike a balance between a website that would appear modern/typical of a website a user would encounter today, with the obvious unreality of intrastellar travel.

## Conclusion

I had a blast (pun intended!) with this project. I used the Skeleton CSS framework as a grid system, and enjoyed working with different (fictional) user stories and backstories.
