## Explanation

Blocbox is a SaaS note-taking application, and was designed in response to other simmilar Saas note-taking applications such as Evernote or SimpleNote.

## Problem

Users needed to be able to log in and follow a smooth on-boarding process, easily take and save a note, and intuitively use the application.

## Solution

Multiple user tests were conducting during the design and prototype production. Invision.io and usabilityhub.com, in conjunction with Sketch high-fidelity wireframes, were used to evaluate user flows, conduct A/B testing, and evalute graphic design elements of the design.


## Conclusion

Designing an application was a large project, and I focused on attempting to make the onboarding process straightforward and having a clean and clear design.

I had the most issues with settling on a clean design. My rich art education and art history background pressed me into one rich color scheme after another, but ultimately I had to scale back the colors significantly to make the design more approachable.
