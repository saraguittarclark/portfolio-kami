## Explanation

Blue Ridge Envisioneering is a local NoVA government contracting company with which I have ties, and I volunteered to update their website. I used Skeleton and Sass, a CSS preprocessor, to expand on my skills. I conducted user testing, but did not alter the copy of the original website.

## Problem

Blue Ridge Envisioneering needed a website that was consistent with current web design practices, responsive, and also retained all of the previous website's functionality and information. 

## Solution

I used the Skeleton CSS framework as a starting point for a fully-responsive website. I updated the artwork and created a landing page for potential clients and potential employees to more clearly get information about the company.

## Conclusion

This project was for an actual stakeholder, instead of an intended/implied stakeholder, and as a result, I was much more focused on aligning the new design with the company branding and values inherent in their previous website.
